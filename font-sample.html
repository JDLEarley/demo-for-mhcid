    <h1>Italian Motorcycles</h1>
    <h2>If you want a motorcycle that works right, have it made in Japan. If you want a motorcycle that looks right, have it made in Italy.</h2>
    <p>Your humble author likes to ride motorcycles. But not just any motorcycles, mind you. Italian motorcycles. Perhaps it's because I am 1/4 Italian. Perhaps it's because I love cars, but four-wheeled vehicles take up too much space and too much money for my wallet to bear. Perhaps it's just because they look so darn good; there's a reason that Ducati is called "<a href="https://www.cycleworld.com/new-ducati-motorcycles/">the Ferrari of motorcycles</a>."</p><br>
    <p>Whatever it may be, one thing is certain: The author's motorcycles are not getting much use these days. Between work, school, and gubernatorial "stay at home" orders, tires are rarely rotating. Italian motorcycles need considerable "care and feeding" and suffer reliability problems quickly, especially with lack of use. Here's hoping they still operate whenever they can be brought out of the garage again!</p>
